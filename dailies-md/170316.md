## Day 0

### TL;DR

Check the Atom [Music for programming](https://github.com/max-devjs/atom-music-for-programming) (work in progress) package.

### Longer Story

A lot of things caught my attention today. Initial idea was to (start to) switch this repo to Material as soon as possible, but when I did see a tweet about [Music for the Programming](#music) I remembered that a few times I listened to [Music for programming](http://musicforprogramming.net/) episodes.

This repo is still rough but usable, then I decided that today would be nice to have a command line version of [Music for programming](http://musicforprogramming.net/). As I find out, already exists a nice NPM [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/music-for-programming) for it.

So, what about an editor plugin / package / ...? Personally I am currently focused on Nvim and VS Code but, again, a tweet did help me to choose [Atom](#atom). And, above all, I quickly realized that would be so easier, as I explain in the [next](#whatidid) section.

### What I did

I found that [Atom Web View package](https://github.com/gabceb/atom-web-view) is a perfect fit for this project:

  - I did clone the [Atom Web View package](https://github.com/gabceb/atom-web-view) repo
  - I did look around a bit
  - I did use the bare minimum to load a web page in an Atom editor
  - I did implement a few functions (open, close, reload, toggle)
