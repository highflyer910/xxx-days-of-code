## Day -1

### The prologue

First step is always the hardest, right? 

Eager to formally start my [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode?f=tweets), 
[#301daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/301daysofcode?f=tweets), 
[#javascript30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/javascript30?f=tweets), 
probably [#1ppm](https://twitter.com/hashtag/1ppm?f=tweets) and 
[#designeveryday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/designeveryday?f=tweets) (who knows 
how many more nice hashtags will pop up and sink down in the meantime) journey I 
thought that this should be a compelling, personal 
projects driven, experience.

Yes, finally time has come to dust off those famous ideas crammed in that third 
desk drawer.

Wondering about what could be the starting point, I have (informally) followed 
the abovementioned hashtags for some days.

When I saw [BIT-101 LAB](https://bit101.github.io/lab/) I realized that I would 
need a sort of a journal.

It looked a perfect project to start off: cloning and reshaping it at my will 
would then be my first step.

### What I did

So I did. I cloned the [BIT-101 LAB](https://github.com/bit101/lab) source and 
today I began to reshape it.

Currently, even if I am adapting the source to my needs, I still use several 
features of [BIT-101 LAB](https://bit101.github.io/lab/):

  - daily creation workflow
  - calendar
  - [QuickSettings](https://github.com/bit101/quicksettings)
  - ...

Being this an experiment priorities have been to:

  - delete unused files (mainly libs)
  - follow (but adapt) the [original](http://www.bit-101.com/blog/) workflow
    - add or modify (ba)sh shell script to create, publish, etc the daily files 
      - example: if I do not provide a date, the scripts will automatically use "today" as default
  - update readme.md, template.html, index.html, .gitignore, etc
  - create template.md, now.html, package.json, generateReadMe.js, etc
  - create a dailies-md directory where daily entries are generated and stored
  - [write](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code/00-mkdaily-md.sh) the daily entry 
  in markdown (perhaps some day I will switch back to simple markdown in a normal repo)
    - use [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to [translate](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code/01-mkdaily.sh) 
    the markdown to html (idea from [How to include markdown (.md) files inside html files](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37770620/how-to-include-markdown-md-files-inside-html-files))
    - [include](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code/01-mkdaily.sh) it in the 
    daily html template with a bit of [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) 
    and clean things up
    - [publish](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code/02-publish.sh) the final daily html to dailies
    - edit [index.json](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code/index.json) for tags 
    (hopefully some day [automized](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code/03-update-index.json.sh))
    - [push](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code/04-push-to-origin.sh) (yup, via shell script)

That's all for now. 

For posterity, this is how it currently [looks](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code/thumbs/170228.png) like.

### What I will do

  - I won't worry about the NEXT (to the next day) link in daylies
  - play with css
  - slowly morph into an Angular / Material experiment
  - automate the ... transpilation and ... publishing ... on ... save? ARGH!
  - peek into what is possible to do on Github
