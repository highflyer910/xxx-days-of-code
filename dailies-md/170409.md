## Day 23

  Possibly a break day. Playing around with [Polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) and compiling a list of topics to be reviewed during the next few weeks.

## Daily Stuff

  to-check: code, mainly
  to-read: posts, articles, guides, things to read
  to-watch: videos, video courses, things to watch

### Polybar

  1. to-check [Polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar)
  1. to-check [jaagr/dots/.config/polybar/config](https://github.com/jaagr/dots/blob/master/.config/polybar/config)

  Shaping the new bar:

  Till now [Polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) seems more stable than [Yabar](https://github.com/geommer/yabar). Also, has workspace and desktop panel for [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) and [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3) and workspace module for [EWMH compliant](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html#idm140130320786080) window managers. For [Yabar](https://github.com/geommer/yabar) exists [workspace.py](https://github.com/sqozz/workspace.py), a nice but limited option.

  I will continue checking both the projects.
