## About this repo

  Read [about](https://max-devjs.github.io/xxx-days-of-code/dailies/170315.html) how it all started and what is currently planned.

  This repo was born as a clone of [BIT-101 LAB](https://bit101.github.io/lab/): I warmly suggest to check his amazing work.

### Check out the live site

  [max-devjs xxx-days-of-code](https://max-devjs.github.io/xxx-days-of-code/)

### Curiosities

  Originally I thought to call this repo do-it, but [do-it.org](https://do-it.org/) (which in turn seems a very nice project) already exists.

### Libraries
  Libraries currently used in this experiment

  [QuickSettings](https://github.com/bit101/quicksettings)

### Now
  Check out what I am doing right [now](https://max-devjs.github.io/xxx-days-of-code/now.html).

### Rational

  I decided to take advantage of both the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode?f=tweets) and the [#301daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/301daysofcode?f=tweets) "paths" because they look nicely interdependent concepts.

  I can split a medium / long term endeavour as [#301daysofcode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/301daysofcode?f=tweets) in nice shorter goals as [#javascript30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/javascript30?f=tweets) and [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode?f=tweets) to make tangible and sustainable the process. Applies the other way too.

  And I will take it easy. 

  I know that, for several reasons, I will miss more than "a couple" days.

  I know that what most matters to me is [consistence in the medium / long term](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/837344879567065088), not repeating the same day forever.

### Source

  Here you are. Check the [dailies](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code/tree/master/dailies) folder.

### Tags

  [BIT-101 LAB](https://bit101.github.io/lab/) features a nice [tag](https://github.com/bit101/lab/blob/master/js/TagManager.js) system that works excellently. I am enjoying it out of the box.
